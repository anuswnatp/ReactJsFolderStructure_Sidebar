YUHU !


I have created react project Structure with


1.  Eslint configured
2.  Redux with logger and performance tracker
3.  Auth routes and public route management via JWT Tokens and Refresh Tokens 
4.  One of the Best SCSS utility with all the necessary configurations as such 
a)  breakpoints
b)  font setting
c)  padding settings
    and lots of pre build mixins to minimize all kind of development issues
5)  Custom layout with sidebar and added open link to tweak it accordingly
6)  Prime React for styling implemented [ feel free to uninstall ] {Caution sidebar wont work}
    docs for prime react -> https://www.primefaces.org/primereact/showcase/#/
    its free and amazing but prone to BUGS so think before continuing.
